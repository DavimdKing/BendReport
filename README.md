# BendReport
Automatically collect data and analysis 
Traditionally I need 12 hours to work on this report every week, including collecting data from different excels, sorting and filtering, changing format e.g. [data time] -> [yy mm dd], input data, forming graph, analysis the problems, verification and forming power point to present in weekly meeting.
Now, I will create an automatic program to facilitate the processes. The new process should only included collecting data from different excels, program running, analysis the problems and forming power point. I expect this program can help to reduce 80% of the original time to complete the report.

This is my first project and I will ignore the size of program because the time it ran compares with 12 hours is nothing.
